          A vision statement is the anchor point of any strategic plan. It outlines what an organization would
          like to ultimately achieve and gives purpose to the existence of the organization. A well-written
          vision statement should be short, simple, specific to your business, leave nothing open to
          interpretation.

            The vision statement is the company's desired future position for the business. Whereas, the
            mission statement is essentially the definition of a company's current business state and
            objectives. Generic vision statements that could apply to any organization won't cut it.

            Time is of the essence. Young people need high-quality programming now more than ever. Your
            funders and partners are requesting your services. Now you must ensure that the teams on the
            ground have the knowledge and skills they need for successful implementation. Without a clear
            system of high-quality training and support, your youth-focused initiative may not sustain.

            I have a loyalty that runs in my bloodstream, when I lock into someone or something, you can't get
            me away from it because I commit that thoroughly. That's in friendship, that's a deal, that's a
            commitment. Don't give me paper - I can get the same lawyer who drew it up to break it. But if you
            shake my hand, that's for life.
